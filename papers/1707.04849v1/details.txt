Title: Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples
Authors: Michail Schlesinger, Evgeniy Vodolazskiy
Summary: The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine
learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are
looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is
free of those flaws.
